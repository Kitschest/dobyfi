# dobyfi

This is a README.md that will have all the necessary instructions to complete a Web application for our 2nd project on Ironhack, Team Pedro Torres & Xavi Trallero. 

We'll be building an Express app, which means we'll learn/practice what it takes to make a functional application from the ground up.

<h1> Dobify, a fintech to empower young generations understand how economy works</h1>

<h2><b>Technical Requirements</b></h1>

Our app must:
<li>Use Express as a foundation</li>
<li>Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
<li>Have 2 models or more. Having one for users is a no-brainer. The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app. Don’t force it if having more than two models doesn’t make sense.
<li>Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
<li>Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
<li>Implement all CRUD actions on models other than users. You should have the Create, Read, Update and Delete features even if they aren’t all for the same model.
<li>Have a repo on GitHub.
<li>Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on.
<li>Be deployed online using Heroku so that anybody could use your app</li>
